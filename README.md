# João Pedro Vasconcelos
<sub>*Computer Engineering undergrad student* at Universidade Federal da Paraíba</sub>

Hey, I'm João Pedro. (Since it's a complicated name to pronounce in english, you can call me JP)

I'm from São Paulo, Brazil. Though, I have spent most of my life where I currently live João Pessoa, Brazil.

I'm a Computer Engineering Undergrad student at the [Federal University of Paraíba](https://www.ufpb.br), and a Machine Learning Researcher at [ArIA - Artificial Intelligence Applications Laboratory](https://aria.ci.ufpb.br), where I've been studying Artificial Intelligence for the past months.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy learning random stuff, traveling, playing Dungeons & Dragons, and caffeine :)

**Background in:** C/C++, Python, Machine Learning, Data Analysis.

## Projects:
* [GANdido Portinari](https://github.com/ItamarRocha/GANdido-Portinari): In this project we trained a CycleGan to reproduce Candido's Portinari style into photos of places and people.  Coauthors:  [Itamar Rocha Filho](https://github.com/ItamarRocha), [João Wallace Lins](https://github.com/joallace), [Felipe Honorato](https://github.com/Felipehonorato1).
* [Melanoma Detection Tool](https://github.com/jpvt/melanoma-detection): This tool can support dermatological clinic work by evaluating a patient's moles to identify outlier lesions or “ugly ducklings” that are most likely to be melanoma. Made with PyTorch, Flask and Dockerized application.
* [IQ Option Bot](https://bit.ly/2ZmsgTQ): Project for AI Class at Universidade Federal da Paraíba. Coauthors:  [Itamar Rocha Filho](https://github.com/ItamarRocha), [João Wallace Lins](https://github.com/joallace)
